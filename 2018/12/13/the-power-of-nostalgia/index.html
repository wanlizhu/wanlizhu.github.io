<p>Fast forwarding to the 19th and 20th centuries, nostalgis became now classified as a <strong>psychological disorder</strong> where experts thought if their patients spent too much time thinking about the past, they weren’t living in the present and that was a disease. In 2018, we have realized that is not the case.</p>
<p>Nostalgia can be a very positive emotion that <strong>is stabilizing to</strong> us during times of change and transition. As humans we need nostalgia to constantly remind us of meaning in our lives, and those of us who never experienced nostalgia are actually a little bit worse than those who experience on a regular basis. That warm comforting feeling that you get when you reminisce about something that happened in the past, that’s nostalgis.</p>

<h2><span id="what-brings-on-nostalgia">What brings on nostalgia?</span></h2><p>Science tells us that during moments of change and transition, we’re most likely to experience the feelings of nostalgia. They’re calming, they give us motivation to get through whatever challenges lay ahead of us. It’s not so much that we look at the presidents, “oh, this is awful, it used to be so much better back then”, it’s about finding meaning in what we’ve accomplished in the past to allow us to be more motivated and accomplish our goals in the future. It’s really a positive emotion and has sort of been ill-defined in the past. </p>
<p>Interestingly, your senses are very well connected to that part of your brain if you were to smell something you’ve connected with a past memory that could trigger feelings of nostalgia. You smell the cologne or perfume on somebody and it brings you back to an experience that you had with a partner in your early years, that’s nostalgia. Hearing a song brings you back to wherever you first heard that song, that’s nostalgia in full effect, and I would say music is probably the most common trigger of that. </p>
<h2><span id="is-nostalgia-always-a-good-thing">Is nostalgia always a good thing?</span></h2><p>The feelings of nostalgia are generally good, but there is a thin line there where it can become <strong>pathologic</strong> or a bad thing. Take for instance, someone who has historical nostalgia which is where they live in the present, but they hate everything about it and want it to be more like the past, they’ll do anything to disconnect themselves from the present and try to make things like how they used to be.</p>
<p>There’s certain times where you can do that in a positive way where you can take aspects of things that were great in the past and bring them to the present or even the future, but there’s also bad ways of doing that. It’s important to note that <strong>with every good things, too much of it, can be a bad thing</strong>.</p>
<p>Think of one of your greatest memories. In fact, think of any memory. Doesn’t it seem like you were having an amazing time? Doesn’t it seem like it can’t compare to the present? When thinking about the present, you <strong>inherently</strong> think about the future. The future carries stress and worry. Worry is the best way to keep happiness at bay (rhymed on purpose). On the other hand, when thinking about the past, you inherently AREN’T thinking about the future. This makes the past appear <strong>superior to</strong> the present, aka, nostalgia.</p>
<p>Memory is an imperfect tool. We think about memory as being something very exact, a science. It’s not like that as all. The more you access a memory in the further away that memory is, the more likely it is you’re to change it and forget key details. Sometimes people refer to this as Rosy <strong>retrospection</strong>. Essentially what you are doing is <strong>exhibiting</strong> a <strong>cognitive bias</strong> when you’re thinking something was amazing, it might have been a stressful time if were to dive into your head in that given moment. </p>
<p>You can actually see how this type of nostalgia or rosy retrospection can be a survival tool, because if you want to <strong>foster</strong> well-being in a society in your own mind, it’s best to not remember all those stressful details and instead bring that positive motivation forward. Essentially what you’re doing, as a human, is creating meaning for yourself in a world where it’s very easy to get lost and even confused at times.</p>
