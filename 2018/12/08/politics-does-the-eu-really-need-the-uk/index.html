<h2><span id="trade-dependency">Trade Dependency</span></h2><p><img src="/2018/12/08/politics-does-the-eu-really-need-the-uk/the-eu-trade-relying-on-the-uk.png" alt="The EU&#39;s imports and exports to/from the UK"></p>
<p>The UK is the second biggest country in the EU at about 2.2 trillion pounds after Germany which has an economy at about 3.1 trillion pounds. When you combine the economic power of all of the member nations, the EU as a whole, has an economy worth about 14.6 trillion pounds. As I’m sure you’ve heard a million times before, the EU is obviously a far larger block than the UK in terms of people and the size of economy, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that the UK needs the EU more than the EU needs the UK. </p>
<p>A more reliable indicator might be how much each side relies on the other for trade. In 2007, 53% of UK imports, worth 257 billion pounds, came from the EU, and 44% of the UK’s exports, worth 162 billion pounds, went to the EU, that’s a lot of the UK’s trade. It is sort of true that the UK is relying less on the EU for the trade than they used to do. While the UK is starting to export more to the rest of the world, the UK are <strong>simultaneously</strong> increasing the amount we export to the EU according to HMRC.</p>
<p>In 2011, the EU made up about 51% of the UK’s imports, in 2017, it was 53%, and it might still be rising according to HMRC. In the years since May 2017, the UK imported 55% of their goods from the EU and exported 51% of their goods to the EU. Also, these numbers don’t even include countries, like Norway or Switzerland, who aren’t part of the EU but are within the EU regulatory framework. </p>
<h3><span id="the-rotterdam-effect">The Rotterdam Effect</span></h3><p><img src="/2018/12/08/politics-does-the-eu-really-need-the-uk/rotterdam-effect.png" alt="The Rotterdam Effect"></p>
<p>Some people argue the UK actually does less trade with the EU than the numbers might say because of the Rotterdam Effect. Basically, Britain sends some of their exports destined for non-EU countries through Rotterdam ports before they go on to their intended destination, the same things happens to imports, with some of their imports passing through Rotterdam before they head to the United Kingdom. This is counted as EU trade when it could or maybe even should be counted as non-EU trade. </p>
<p>Though it’s hard to quantify how much of an impact this has, the ONS have estimated that it could affect 2% of UK-EU trade. Even without the Rotterdam effects, it’s pretty clear that the UK needs the EU quite a bit when it comes to trade. But, let’s see how much it works the other way around. If we don’t look at countries within the EU27, the UK is the second biggest export market for goods placing behind the US, as of 2017. Trade with the UK makes up about 16% of the goods that the EU exports to non-EU27 countries. </p>
<p>However, it’s important to note that this isn’t really fair given the UK is currently within the single market, they’ve got a competitive advantage against all other non-EU trading partners. If the UK were to leave the single market customs union and free trade area, that number would almost certainly drop, when you include EU27 countries within the analysis, like economic powerhouses, Germany and France. the UK makes up about 8% of the EU’s exports and about 4% of the imports. When it comes to trade, it looks like the UK needs the EU much more than the EU need the UK. </p>
<h2><span id="german-car-industry">German Car Industry</span></h2><p><img src="/2018/12/08/politics-does-the-eu-really-need-the-uk/the-uk-s-top-four-areas-of-manufacturing.png" alt="The UK&#39;s top four areas of manufacturing"></p>
<p>One quick thing we need to cover, it’s such a cliche, but we really do have to deal with it, people in favor of brexit love to bring up the EU won’t let us leave and unfavorable terms as the German car industry relies on us too much. It’s pretty easy to understand why the German car industry is brought up so regularly as it’s a huge industry worth an estimated 482.7 billions euros in 2016, and when you consider some of the mammoth car brands who manufacture in Germany, that’s hardly surprising. </p>
<p>So, should these companies really be shaking in their boots? A lot of their cars do end up in the UK, the United Kingdom is actually their biggest market, buying 769,000 German cars a year, far ahead of the US who’s in the second place importing 494,000 cars a year. This makes life difficult for German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, she said, back in 2016, that she didn’t want industry bosses interfering with the delicate negotiations. But she also doesn’t want it to look like she isn’t protecting German businesses and jobs that said, if the UK leaves with no deal at all, it could seriously affect the German supply chain. </p>
<p><img src="/2018/12/08/politics-does-the-eu-really-need-the-uk/the-german-supply-chain-could-be-torn-apart.png" alt="The German supply chain could be torn apart"></p>
<p>With the CEO of the German lobbying group who represents BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler, saying that the supply chains could be torn apart. Despite this, he claims that the UK will be hit harder than Germany with jobs and production facilities being moved from the UK back to the EU after brexit, and this isn’t just <strong>hypothetical</strong> job losses, a number of car companies have said that they’re not investing in the UK or pulling investment due to brexit and the uncertainty around it. This is actually very important for the UK where the top four areas of manufacturing are all related to the manufacturing of vehicles.</p>
<h2><span id="the-eu-budget">The EU Budget</span></h2><p>Another reason that’s often given when people say that the EU needs the UK is the money that the UK contributes the EU budget. So, how much does the UK actually pay the EU? Well, for starters, it’s not the 350 million pounds per week that certain buses might have you believe that all amounts a little over 18 billion pounds a year which is what the UK would pay if they didn’t have a rebate. </p>
<h3><span id="the-rebate">The Rebate</span></h3><p>The rebate was negotiated by Thatcher in 1984, it was basically because, back then, about 70% of the EU budget was spent on the common agricultural policy, and most of this money went on subsidizing French farming, while the UK didn’t get much out of it at all because of the complicated way that funding allocation is calculated. But what it basically boiled down to was the UK hasn’t got as many fields as France, and as such, doesn’t get as much money. The UK obviously didn’t like subsidizing inefficient French farmers, so they negotiated a rebate which means that the UK doesn’t pay as much as we would otherwise. Most EU countries obviously hate this, but it sort of makes sense, the Common Agricultural Policy still accounts for 37% of the EU’s expenditure and the UK still doesn’t get much money from it.</p>
<p>The rebate essentially saves the UK a lot of money, about 4 billion pounds each year, so they end up paying more like 14 billion pounds in the EU’s budget each year which comes to about 250 million pounds a week. This accounts for about 13% of the EU’s budget, making the UK the third biggest contributor after France and Germany, and one of the only ten net countributors, by net contributor, what we mean is the UK is spending more into the EU than they get back.</p>
<p>The UK gets back about 5 billion pounds in public sector spending and about a billion more in private sector credits with all these counted, the UK pays about 136 million pounds a week to the EU.</p>
<p>The EU budget might be a little tighter and they might have to ask more countries to countribute a bit more money, but countries such as Finland have already said that they’re happy to put a bit more in to cover the hole left by the UK. So far, it looks like the EU might be alright without us. </p>
<h2><span id="the-security">The Security</span></h2><p><img src="/2018/12/08/politics-does-the-eu-really-need-the-uk/the-eu-security.png" alt="The EU Security"></p>
<p>However. there’s one area in which the EU might need the UK, and that security while there isn’t an EU army just yet, there are some EU security programs like Europol and the european arrest warrant. All EU states also have access to the second generation Schengen information system, the European criminal records information system, the europol information system, and any information which is shared as a result of pruem decisions, a commitment towards better cross-border cooperation on DNA fingerprints and vehicle registration information, the EU also has a common security and defence policy, at the moment, the UK is one of the biggest militaries in the EU and one of the intelligence services in the world, they play a big role in EU security.</p>
